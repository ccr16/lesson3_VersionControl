## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (Git is is a distributed version control system. This means that every user has a copy of the data stored on their computer)
2. (Version control systems combine project files to one major repository. This makes it simpler for those who are working on shared files to make changes)
3. (There are two types of Repositories, remote and local. Remote repositories reside on a remote server that is shared among multiples. A local repository is on a local machine of an individual user)
