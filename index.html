            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control records charges to files or sets of files so that you are able to revisit specific versions later on. Version control systems allow those who use graphic design or web design to be able to revisit the stages of the images. With version control, you can see every step you have taken to get to the completed version. This means that you are able to see the beginning stages, who caused a problem, and how much the project has progressed. There are multiple ways to utilize version control. Majority of people copy files. There are several different types of version control. Local version control, centralized version control, and distributed version control systems.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is the version control system that we will be using in class. It is a distributed version control system. This means that every user has a copy of the data stored on their computer. You are able to work offline due to it being a local repository. There are basic git commands that we will be using in this class. The three steps are add, commit, and push. This is important to this class because we will be working on the same files, which gives everyone access to read them. Currently in class, we connected out Cloud 9 accounts with GitHub using SSH remotes. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">More on Version Control</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">
Version control systems combine project files to one major repository. This makes it simpler for those who are working on shared files to make changes. Version control systems automatically make note of when files were changed, who changed them, what was changed, and makes sure that the files have all been changed. Two people may work on the same file at once. It is also possible for those working to view the beginning, middle, and end stages of the files. The version control system also backs up all the files. There are two types of Repositories, remote and local. Remote repositories reside on a remote server that is shared among multiples. A local repository is on a local machine of an individual user.

                <span class="text-muted">Why are these topics interesting?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The topics of Version Control and Git are both very interesting because itâ€™s important to know how developers all over the world work and share code and projects. Git manages to merge all changes to files and make sure that no information is lost or not held accountable for. Git is just one of the many versions of repositories out there. Version control is important for documents that are being revised multiple times by many different developers. It makes it easier for users to trace changes that have been made or that need to be made.

                <span class="text-muted">Why Version Control and Git are Important </span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">I feel like both of these topics are relevant to the course because we will be using them in almost every lesson. It makes it easier for the class to share documents as well as work on them. I think that version control systems and Git are things that we will be utilizing in our careers in technology. These are skills that we will continue to use in this class as well as other coding classes and careers in the future. After this lesson, I have a clear understanding of what Version control and Git are and how to use them, and work with them.
